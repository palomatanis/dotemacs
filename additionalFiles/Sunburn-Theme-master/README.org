* Sunburn Theme for Emacs and iTerm2
** Overview
This is a low-contrast theme for Emacs and iTerm2. After using Zenburn for
several years, I decided I wanted something a bit different, but in the same
spirit, so I went looking for colors I liked. I've always liked the palette of
old Sun workstations and boxes, combining shades of gray and purple. 

Turns out, they don't work very well for text, but they did provide a starting
point for exploration. The main palette for this theme looks like this:


#+NAME: fig:palette
#+CAPTION: Sunburn palette
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 60
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60px
[[file:./img/palette.png]]


In use, it looks like this:


#+NAME: fig:screen1
#+CAPTION: Org-mode / Clojure
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 1200
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1200px
[[file:./img/screen1.png]]


#+NAME: fig:screen2
#+CAPTION: Emacs lisp / LaTeX
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 1200
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1200px
[[file:./img/screen2.png]]


Since I also use iTerm2 quite a bit, I did a port of the theme to it.


#+NAME: fig:iterm
#+CAPTION: iTerm2
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 970
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 970px
[[file:./img/iterm.png]]

** Installation

 For iTerm, simply import the theme from the drop-down in the =Preferences →
 Profiles → Colors= pane. 

 On Emacs, you can install it either from MELPA, or alternatively:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code :results silent
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "path/where/you/put/the/theme/")
  (load-theme 'sunburn)
#+END_SRC
